However, its limited specific capacity and poor rate performance have hindered broader applications. This study introduces an innovative approach to address these limitations by preparing Zr-doped Li4Ti5O12 4 Ti 5 O 12 coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (LTO-0.1Zr@rGO) using a wet chemical method combined with freeze-drying technology. The incorporation of Zr ions into the LTO lattice resulted in an increase in the lattice parameter and the unit cell volume. This increase facilitated the transmission of lithium ions and enhanced the material's conductivity. Furthermore, the rGO coating was found to significantly enhance the rate performance and cycle stability of the material. The LTO-0.1Zr@rGO composite demonstrated a high rate capacity ranging from 396.5 to 263.6 mAh g- 1 at current densities varying from 0.2 to 5.0 A g- 1 , with a stable capacity of 310.2 mAh g- 1 maintained after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g- 1 .

22,doc_22,"Lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12,LTO) has emerged as an excellent anodic material for Li+-ion batteries with great potential for development and application owing to itszero strain property. In this study, Li4Ti5O12 was synthesized via a high-temperature solid-phase technique employing low-cost industrial metatitanic acid containing S/Nb hetero ions as the titanium source and LiOH center dot H2O as a lithium source. So that the S/Nb hetero ions in the metatitanic acid were converted into dopant to achieve in-situ co-doping in the process of high-temperature calcination.

The degree of fluorination of the MWCNTs was controlled by modifying the reaction time at constant fluorination temperature; the clear structure and surface functional group changes in the MWCNTs due to the degree of fluorination were determined. In addition, the homogeneous dispersion in the LTO was improved due to the strong electronegativity of fluorine.

The sulfur in the samples is mainly deposited on the surface as sulfate and Li2S2 as deduced from XPS. However, most of the nominal sulfur is lost. Interestingly, for nominal x = 0.125 a considerable improvement in performance is achieved compared to undoped LTO.

The morphology and structure of the composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. The electrochemical performance of the composites with different graphene contents as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries was investigated by various electrochemical techniques. In the absence of acetylene black (AB), the G/SG composites were found to exhibit high specific capacity with high first-cycle coulombic efficiency, good cycling stability, and high rate performance. Compared with the natural spherical graphite (SG) electrode, the G/SG composite electrode with 1% graphene exhibited higher reversible capacity after 50 cycles; This capacity performance was equal to that of the SG + 10%AB electrode. Moreover, when the addition of 2.5% graphene, the composite electrode exhibited higher initial charge capacity and reversible capacity during 50 cycles than the SG+10%AB electrode. The significant improvement of the electrochemical performance of the G/SG composite electrodes could be attributed to graphene wrapping. The graphene shell enhances the structural integrity of the natural SG particles during the lithiation and delithiation processes, further improving the cycling stability of the composites. Moreover, the bridging of adjacent SG particles allows the formation of a highly conductive network for electron transfer among SG particles. Graphene in the composites serves as not only an active material but also a conductive agent and promotes the improvement of electrochemical performance. When 5%AB was added, the reversible capacity of the 5%G/SG electrodes significantly increased from 381.1 to 404.5 mAh.g(-1) after 50 cycles at a rate of 50 mA.g(-1) and from 82.5 to 101.9 mAh.g(-1) at 1 A.g(-1), suggesting that AB addition improves the performance of the G/SG composite electrodes.

The oxygen vacancy (OV) content in LTO can be controlled quantitatively by high-pressure induction using the high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) method. In addition, the relationship between the electrochemical properties and OV is further explored. The theoretical calculations indicate that the OV defects cause the electrons to delocalize into the conduction band of the LTO, and thus fundamentally improve the intrinsic conductivity. In particular, the high-pressure quenching strategy of HPHT causes LTO to instantly produce crack holes with massive crystalline layers, which can be regarded as storage for the electrolyte to facilitate ion diffusion. The fabricated LTO anodes containing OVs compensate for the limitation of the poor rate performance with a capacity of 176 mAh g(-1) at 20 C.

To achieve this goal, the Mg2+_Cr3+ co-doping LNMO microspheres were prepared via the coprecipitation route. FTIR, Raman spectra and magnetic susceptibility verify that both the Mg2+ and Cr3+ doping are beneficial for the formation of disordered Fd3m phase leading to the improvement of electronic conductivity and decrease in electrochemical polarization and the charge transfer resistance (Rct). Meanwhile, the doping also reduces the content of Mn3+ in LNMO which can diminish the dissolution of Mn3+ resulting in the enhancement of cycling life.

Firstly, a large number of particles with well-defined shapes were prepared on the commercial copper foil surface via a very simple soaking process, in which the soaking solution contained only CuSO4, H2SO4 and [Bmim]I. As indicated by the XRD and XPS measurements, the particles observed on the surface of the copper foil were identified as CuI particles.

Improving the conductivity of electrode materials is one of the effective ways to solve this technical bottleneck. Here, we incorporated highly conductive MXene and carbon nanotubes into the electrode materials of Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) and LiFePO4 (LFP) to construct the composite electrode material 3D-LTO-CNT-MXene and 3D-LFP-CNT-MXene (named 3D-LTO and 3D-LFP). The 3D-LTO we synthesized demonstrated an impressive capacity of 146.2 mAh g-1 at a 20C rate (where 1C = 175 mA g-1), the 3D-LFP material exhibited a capacity of 104.6 mAh g-1 at a 20C rate (where 1C = 170 mA g-1). This remarkable rate capability can be attributed to the constructed three-dimensional conductive network, which facilitates enhanced electrical conductivity and electron migration rates, thereby promoting rapid charging and discharging of the batteries.

Although substantial advancements have been made in printed LIBs for shape-versatile electronics, the development of printable solid-state electrolytes remains challenging due to the difficulty of simultaneously achieving desirable rheological properties and ionic conductivity. In this study, a solvent-free, non-flammable solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) is designed as a novel three-dimensional (3D) printable electrolyte via direct ink writing (DIW) for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs).

Additionally, precise control over polymer molecular weight and electrolyte composition enables high printing resolution (similar to 100 mu m), high ionic conductivity (0.705 mS cm(-1) at 25 degrees C), and intrinsic non-flammability. A 3D-printed ASSB, featuring a LiFePO4 cathode and Li4Ti5O12 anode with a mass loading of 7 mg cm(-2), achieves a high areal capacity of 1.14 mAh cm(-2), surpassing all previously reported directly printed ASSBs.
