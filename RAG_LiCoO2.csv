31,doc_31,"The growing consumption of lithium-ion batteries calls for recycling of electrode materials. Conventional direct recycling mainly consists of cathode-to-cathode and anode-to-anode strategies. In this work, a cathode-to-anode approach is proposed using a LiCoO2 model system and extending to Co-lean/Co-free cathodes (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, LiMn2O4, and LiFePO4). Commercial cathodes are featured with single-crystalline or secondary-particle polycrystalline morphology, thus exhibiting higher tap density than anodes (LiCoO2 2.7 g cm(-3) vs Si 0.25 g cm(-3)). By means of an intuitively direct conversion, the anodes are bestowed with well-assembled morphology and high tap density from cathodes. During discharging, a dual conductive network is formed to facilitate lithium storage, where the binder-derived carbon functions as electronic-conductive and LiF/Li2O as ionic-conductive motifs. Recycled cathodes exhibit an outstanding rate volumetric capacity (883 mAh cm(-3), 5 A g(-1), LiCoO2) and cyclic performance (1286 mAh cm(-3), 1000 cycles, 2 A g(-1), LiMn2O4). The morphologically inherited cathode-to-anode strategy proves to be a universal method for battery recycling toward high volumetric energy density.",LiCoO2,883 mAh cm(-3),5 A g(-1),N/A,1000
32,doc_32,"Increasing the charging cut-off voltage can significantly improve the capacity of LiCoO2 cathode. However, when the cut-off voltage exceeds 4.5 V (vs Li/Li+), LiCoO2 undergoes irreversible phase transitions, leading to particle cracking and structural failure. Additionally, the decomposition of the electrolyte compromises the stability of the cathode/electrolyte interface, resulting in diminished battery capacity. Herein, the elements Al, Mg, and Zr are doped into single-crystal LiCoO2 to enhance the structural stability of LiCoO2. Moreover, a 3 & Aring; zeolite film is used to regulate the solvation structure to enhance the oxidation resistance of the electrolyte. This design enables a more stable cathode/electrolyte interface during high-voltage cycling. At a cut-off voltage of 4.8 V, the Li||LiCoO2 battery exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 236.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and maintains 86.6% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C.

33,doc_33,"Inactive elemental doping is commonly used to improve the structural stability of high-voltage layered transition-metal oxide cathodes. However, the one-step co-doping strategy usually results in small grain size since the low diffusivity ions such as Ti4+ will be concentrated on grain boundaries, which hinders the grain growth. In order to synthesize large single-crystal layered oxide cathodes, considering the different diffusivities of different dopant ions, we propose a simple two-step multi-element co-doping strategy to fabricate core-shell structured LiCoO2 (CS-LCO). In the current work, the high-diffusivity Al3+/Mg2+ ions occupy the core of single-crystal grain while the low diffusivity Ti4+ ions enrich the shell layer. The Ti4+-enriched shell layer (similar to 12 nm) with Co/Ti substitution and stronger Ti-O bond gives rise to less oxygen ligand holes. In-situ XRD demonstrates the constrained contraction of c-axis lattice parameter and mitigated structural distortion. Under a high upper cut-off voltage of 4.6 V, the single-crystal CS-LCO maintains a reversible capacity of 159.8 mAh g(-1) with a good retention of similar to 89% after 300 cycles, and reaches a high specific capacity of 163.8 mAh g(-1) at 5C. The proposed strategy can be extended to other pairs of low- (Zr4+, Ta5+, and W6+, etc.) and high-diffusivity cations (Zn2+, Ni2+, and Fe3+, etc.) for rational design of advanced layered oxide core-shell structured cathodes for lithium-ion batteries.",N/A,163.8 mAh g(-1),5C,N/A,300

In this paper, silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4)-assisted roasting was developed to recover LiCl, CoCl2, and Co3O4 from spent lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) batteries. At 500 degrees C and a SiCl4/LiCoO2 mass ratio of 3:1, 95.6% of Co was recovered as CoCl2 and 98.4% of Li was recovered as LiCl.

Among solid-state electrolytes, sulfide-based options like Li6PS5Cl are especially promising due to their superior ionic conductivity. However, interfacial degradation between sulfide electrolytes and high-voltage cathodes, such as LiCoO2, limits long-term performance. This study demonstrates that a LiBF4-derived F-rich coating on LiCoO2, applied by immersing LiCoO2 particles in a LiBF4 solution followed by annealing, can significantly enhance performance in Li6PS5Cl-based solid-state batteries.

141,doc_141,"Lithium-ion batteries are core components of flexible electronic devices. However, deformation types, such as impinging, bending, stretching, folding, and twisting, can cause internal cracks and, eventually, damage these batteries. The cracks separate the active particles from the conductive particles and the binder, as well as the electrode from the collector. Self-healing binders can alleviate this mechanical damage and improve the stress response of active material particles during high rates of charging and discharging of these batteries and the operation at a high voltage, thereby enhancing their cycle performance. In the present study, a thermoplastic intrinsic self-healing polymer (TISP) binder is proposed. The TISP is obtained by polymerization of butanediol (2,3BDO), propylene glycol (1,3-PDO), succinic acid (SuA), sebacic acid (SeA), and iconic acid (IA). The hydroxyl and ester groups in its structure can form diverse bonds including the hydrogen and ion-dipole with active particles and the current collector, thereby producing elevated adhesion. Its properties, including a low glass transition temperature (-60 degrees C), amorphous structure, and low cross-link density, improve the mobility of polymer chains at 40 degrees C, and this facilitates structural recovery and the maintenance of strong adhesions. Owing to its higher occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level than the electrolyte solvent, the TISP is likely oxidized before the main component of the electrolyte during charging. This decomposition produces a chemical passivation interphase on the cathode which reduces side reactions of LiCoO2 and the electrolyte under high voltage conditions. Tests reveal that a LiCoO2 electrode battery using the TISP as a binder retains 162.4 mAh g-1 after 349 cycles at 4.5 V, and this represents an 86.5% capacity retention. In addition, heating (40 degrees C, 1 h) of a scratch-damaged electrode can recover a specific capacity of 156.6 mAh g-1 after 349 cycles at 4.5 V. Relative to a battery without any mechanical scratch, this capacity recovery represents approximately 96%, and this demonstrates the importance of the TISP to the high-voltage damaged electrode.",LiCoO2,162.4 mAh g-1 (156.6 mAh g-1 after heating),N/A,4.5 V,349

143,doc_143,"All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSLIBs) based on sulfide solid-state electrolytes (S-SSEs) are considered as one of the most promising choices to address the safety hazards of traditional lithium-ion batteries. However, the high-voltage cathodes, such as LiCoO2 (LCO) with high-valence Co (+3), tend to spontaneously oxidize S-SSEs, causing polarization increase and rapid degradation. Herein, a self-sacrificing reductive interphase consisting of CoO/Li2CO3/C, is in situ constructed on LCO surface via a simple carbon-induced thermal reduction of LCO. With such a design, the Co valence of LCO surface is reduced to +2, reducing the oxidative nature of LCO to avoid reactions with S-SSEs. As a result, ASSLIBs using Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) S-SSEs achieve a high initial capacity of 144.9 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C and retard 93.1% of initial capacity after 100 cycles. Additionally, excellent rate cyclability of 109.2 mAh g-1 at 1.0 C with 81.5% retentive capacity for 200 cycles is attained as well. Comprehensive evidence strongly demonstrates the effectiveness of this self-sacrificing reductive interphase in inhibiting the interfacial reactions and ensuring long-term cyclability. The proposed concept of a self-sacrificing reductive interface in this study paves the way for stabilizing the cathode/SSEs interface and offers a novel approach for the design of high-performance sulfide-based ASSLIBs. The notion of interface reconstruction through self-sacrificial reduction is proposed. Citric acid is employed as reducing agent for the thermal reduction of LCO, facilitating the generation of an in situ coating on the surface of LCO.

It is shown that Al, Ta:LLZO can be formed directly in the presence of LCO from metal oxide precursors (LiOH, La2O3, ZrO2, Al2O3, and Ta2O5) by heating to 1050 degrees C, eliminating the time- and energy-consuming synthesis of preformed LLZO powders. In addition, performance-optimized gradient microstructures can be produced by sequential casting of slurries with different compositions, resulting in dense and flat phase-pure cathodes without unwanted ion interdiffusion or secondary phase formation. Freestanding cathodes with a thickness of 85 mu m, a relative density of 95%, and an industrial relevant LCO loading of 15 mg show an initial capacity of 82 mAh g-1 (63% of the theoretical capacity of LCO) in a solid-state cell with Li metal anodes, which is comparable to conventional LCO/LLZO cathodes and can be further improved in the future.

The key regeneration processes are composition replenishment and atom rearrangement, both of which depend on the migration and diffusion of atoms. However, for the direct recycling of degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (D-NCM523) cathode, the irreversible phase transitions that accumulate during the long-term cycles block the Li diffusion channels with a high diffusion energy barrier, making it difficult to fully repair the layered structure and resulting in rapid capacity decay. To address the challenge, fast Li replenishment channels are rebuilt to regulate the surface phase and effectively assist the regeneration process with a reduced energy barrier. This method reduces the amount of Li supplement by >75% and shortens the sintering time (only 2 h) to fully regenerate D-NCM523, compared to general direct recycling methods. The regenerated NCM523 (LCMB-NCM523) exhibits a satisfactory repaired specific capacity of 160 mAh g(-1) and excellent cycling stability, retaining 78% of its capacity after 300 cycles.

186,doc_186,"LiCoO2 has been one of the dominant cathode materials commercially used in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, while the performance is severely limited by its low reversible capacity (similar to 140 mAh/g), primarily due to the destructive phase transitions at high voltages (>4.2 V vs Li/Li+), leading to structural degradation and rapid decay of capacity. A recent experimental study [Wang et al. Nature2024, 629, 341] showed that chemical short-range disorder (CSRD) in LiCoO2 can effectively prevent phase transitions and structural deterioration. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we carry out a theoretical study on CSRD-based LiCoO2 by performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations accelerated by machine learning and find that CSRD effectively suppresses phase transitions from hexagonal to monoclinic at Li0.5CoO2 and from O3 to H1-3 at Li0.25CoO2. The enhanced phase stability is attributed to the reduced lattice variation in the c-axis, the increased oxygen vacancy formation energies, the higher oxygen dimer formation energies, and the stabilization of Co atoms in the Li layers during delithiation. The high Li+ diffusion coefficients are found to arise from the low-barrier 0-TM diffusion channels and an expanded diffusion network from 2D to quasi-3D induced by CSRD. Furthermore, CSRD narrows the band gap of LiCoO2 with enhanced electronic conductivity, driven by the changes in the Co valence state and the introduction of linear Li-O-Li configurations.

In this work, the terbium cation and phosphate anion are doped homogeneously into LiCoO2 and LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 cathodes via the facile solid phase reaction method. We found that the lattice oxygen can be stabilized by the introduction of the Tb element, leading to the mitigation of structural degradation.

Theoretically, the incorporation of the Tb element into the crystal lattice can alleviate oxygen redox activity in the high delithiation state. Thus, the introduction of an appropriate content of anion and cation dopants synergistically modulates the robust layered structure to suppress structural collapse during cycling.

However, unstable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and undesired phase transitions during fast Li+ diffusivity always incur an inferior stability of the high-voltage LCO (HV-LCO). Here, an ultra-thin amorphous titanium dioxide (TiO2) coating layer engineered on LCO by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) strategy is demonstrated to improve the high-rate and long-cycling properties of the HV-LCO cathode.

The results show that the average Li+ diffusion coefficient is nearly tripled with a high-rate capability of 125 mAh g-1 at 5C. An improved cycling stability with a high-capacity retention (86.7%) after 300 cycles at 1C is also achieved, far outperforming the bare LCO (37.9%). The in situ XRD and ex situ XPS results demonstrate that the dense and stable CEI induced by the surface TiO2 coating layer buffers heterogenous lithium flux insertion during cycling and prevents electrolyte, which contributes to the excellent cycling stability of LCO-ALD50.

However, LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 suffers from poor intrinsic rate capability due to its poor ionic conductivity (2.54 x 10(-7) S/cm) and poor cycle stability owing to the volume change of the cathode materials during cycling. To address this issue, honeycomb-shaped LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 was developed for lithium-ion batteries using a sol-gel method with spherical polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particles. PMMA particles provide spherical voids in LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 cathode materials due to their relatively low decomposition temperature (< 350 degrees C). Honeycomb-shaped LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 has a higher surface area (2.63 m(2)/g) than the LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 (2.00 m(2)/g) produced by conventional sol-gel method. The initial discharge capacities of conventional nano LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 and honeycomb-shaped LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 are 151.9 mAh g(-1) and 200.4 mAh g(-1), respectively at 0.1 C. After 50 cycles at 1 C, honeycomb-shaped LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 has a larger capacity retention than conventional nano LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, measuring 67.9% and 58.8%, respectively. The superior electrochemical performance of honeycomb-shaped LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 increases the effective surface area for Li-ion diffusion, leading to better rate capability, and buffers the volume change during Li+ ion insertion/extraction, improving the cycling stability.",LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2,initial discharge capacities (no specific value given),N/A,N/A,N/A
287,doc_287,"The rapid capacity decay of LiCoO 2 (LCO) at high operating voltage is primarily attributed to severe interface/ structure degradation. Surface coating has been recognized as an effective strategy for enhancing the interface/ structure stability of LCO. To achieve a balance between effective protection and fast Li + transport, the selection of suitable coating materials is crucial. In this study, a composite coating layer comprising La 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 was prepared using a simple solid-phase method. The resulting LCO coated with this La 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 layer (LCO@LaZr) showed significantly improved electrochemical performance. After 200 cycles at 1 C, LCO@LaZr demonstrated a higher capacity retention of 90.3% compared to uncoated LCO (46.5%). Furthermore, LCO@LaZr exhibited superior rate capability, achieving a high capacity of 165.6 mAh g - 1 at 10 C, while uncoated LCO delivered a lower capacity of 113.7 mAh g -1 . The La 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 coating enhanced the performance of LCO through a three-inone strategy. La 2 O 3 reduced the Li + diffusion barrier, thereby promoting Li + transport, while ZrO 2 improved the surface/interface stability of the cathode. Moreover, the continuous and uniform La 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 layer effectively prevented direct contact between the cathode and the electrolyte, thereby suppressing undesirable side reactions.

After screening the possible diluents, we found that 2H,3H-decafluoropentane (HFC) satisfies the principle of relatively weak but sufficient interactions with solvation shell, thus strengthening the Li+ coordination and offering electrolytes excellent antioxidant chemistry.

Before the cathode material has been recycled, it is common practice to separate the cathode material from the aluminum foil through pyrolysis in order to analyze its degradation mechanism. However, the impact of the pyrolysis process on cathode materials always overlooked, which can potentially damage the crystal structure and disrupt analysis of failure mechanisms. In this work, we systematically investigate the element migration behavior and phase evolution mechanism of LiNi 0.6 Co 0.2 Mn 0.2 O 2 during both the pyrolysis and regeneration process. During the pyrolysis process, lithium migration to the particle surface is enhanced, resulting in capacity degeneration and the formation of inactive phase and lithium vacancies. Furthermore, our findings highlight that successful regeneration requires optimal temperature control and lithium supplementation. After regeneration, the 3-RNCM750 exhibits a high specific capacity of 175.2 mAh g-1 and 86.87 % of capacity retention at 1.0C after 200 cycles.

290,doc_290,"Al2O3 thin films were deposited on the surfaces of LiFePO4 cathodes via atomic layer deposition (ALD). Electrochemical characterization was used to evaluate the performance improvement of the cathodes coated with the ALD Al2O3 thin films. In rate capability tests, an electrode coated with five ALD cycles of the Al2O3 thin film exhibited the best rate performance among the tested samples when the current rate was lower than 2 C. An electrode coated with 15 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 thin film delivered the highest average specific capacity-88.9 and 61.3 mAh/g at current rates of 5 C and 10 C, respectively-whereas a bare LiFePO4 electrode did not have any capacity at the 10 C rate. These results indicate that the Al(2)O(3 )coating can increase the cathode capacity at high current rates. In a cyclability test, the electrode coated with 15 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 thin film retained the largest capacity after 1000 cycles at a rate of 1 C. The specific capacity of the 15ALD sample at the 1000th cycle was approximately 68% of the capacity at the first cycle, whereas this ratio was reduced to 37% for the bare LiFePO4 electrode. These results indicate that the Al2O3 coating maintains the cathode capacity after many cycles. Thicker Al2O3 coatings result in a high degree of polarization and increased electrode resistance; therefore, the electrode coated with 25 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 thin film exhibited a poorer rate and cycle performance than the 15ALD and 20ALD electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and calculation of the Li(+ )diffusion coefficient revealed that the DLi of the bare LiFePO(4 )electrode was severely reduced after 1000 cycles relative to the electrode coated with 15 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 thin film. This led to a faster decay in the capacity of the bare LiFePO4 electrode after a long-duration test compared with the electrode coated with 15 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 thin film. We conclude that the rate capability and cyclability of the LiFePO4 electrode can be enhanced by depositing Al(2)O(3 )ALD thin films on its surface.

To enable a functional all-solid-state configuration intensive investigations are needed to reduce the cathode/electrolyte interfacial resistance which contributes the most to cell performance loss. Among the commercial cathode materials investigated so far, LiCoO2 (LCO) is one of the most stable with garnet electrolytes as only a superficial reaction has been detected between the two materials. However, even this minor reaction would block the Li-ion transport through the interface, resulting in deteriorated cell performance. In this work, we demonstrate that a thin aluminum oxide layer (5 nm) can be an effective interlayer to impede the formation of a harmful interphase and enable facile Li-ion transfer between LCO and the LLZO garnet. Room-temperature-sputtered LCO thin films were employed to form an interface with the garnet electrolyte and annealed at 800 degrees C to reveal the effect of the interfacial reaction on the Li-ion transfer across the interface. An aluminum oxide layer was then introduced between LCO and the garnet electrolyte by sputtering a metallic aluminum layer which is then annealed together with the upper LCO layer in oxygen, or by direct atomic layer deposition of the oxide. Compared to the LCO/LLZO/Li cells without an aluminum oxide interlayer, those with the interlayer exhibited improved performance, i.e., a stable discharge capacity of up to 90 mAh/(g LCO) at a C/10 rate, a rate capability up to 1.68C and a stable galvanostatic cycling at 0.1C for over 100 cycles with a discharge capacity fade rate of 0.15% per cycle.

Aliovalent ion doping is an effective strategy to increase the ionic conductivity of halide electrolytes. However, the effects of ion doping on the electrochemical stability window of halide electrolytes and carbon additive on electrochemical performance are still unclear by far. Herein, a series of Zr-doped Li3-xEr1-xZrxCl6 halide solid electrolytes (SEs) are synthesized through a mechanochemical method and the effects of Zr substitution on the ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability window are systematically investigated.

In situ polymerization yields electrode/electrolyte interfaces with low interfacial resistance, forming a stable SEI layer enriched with LiF, Li3N, and RCOOLi, ensuring stable Li plating/stripping for over 1400 h. The -C equivalent to N moiety renders the alpha H on the adjacent alpha C positively charged, thereby endowing it with the capability to anchor TFSI-. Simultaneously, the incorporation of -C equivalent to N moiety diminishes the electron-donating ability of the C = O, C-O-C, and -C equivalent to N functional groups, facilitating not only the ion conductivity enhancement but also a more rapid Li+ migration proved by DFT theoretical calculations and Raman spectroscopy.
