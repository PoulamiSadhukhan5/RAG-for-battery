However, this increase in number of lithium-ion batteries also leads to the production of a significant number of spent batteries. Considering the potential environment pollution and waste of resources, it is absolutely imperative to recover these spent lithium-ion batteries.

In spite of this potential, their low discharge capacities and poor rate performances limit them to be used as state-of-the-art SS-LMBs. This arise due to the low intrinsic ionic and electronic transport pathways within the solid components in the cathode during the fast charge/discharge processes. Therefore, it is necessary to have a cathode with good electron conducting channels to increase the active material utilization without blocking the movement of lithium ions. Since SS-LMBs require a different morphology and composition of the cathode, we selected LiFePO4 (LFP) as a prototype and, we have systematically studied the influence of the cathode composition by varying the contents of active material LFP, conductive additives (super C65 conductive carbon black and conductive graphite), ion conducting components (PEO and LiTFSI) in order to elucidate the best ion as well as electron conduction morphology in the cathode. In addition, a comparative study on different cathode slurry preparation methods was made, wherein ball milling was found to reduce the particle size and increase the homogeneity of LFP which further aids fast Li ion transport throughout the electrode. The SEM analysis of the resulting calendered electrode shows the formation of non-porous and crack-free structures with the presence of conductive graphite throughout the electrode. As a result, the optimum LFP cathode composition with solid polymer nanocomposite electrolyte (SPNE) delivered higher initial discharge capacities of 114 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C rate at 30 degrees C and 141 mAh g(-1) at 1C rate at 70 degrees C.

The conventional recycling methods, such as pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy, usually involve various processes like calcining, leaching, enriching, purifying, precipitating, and filtering. They are associated with high energy consumption, large amounts of acid and alkali reagent utilization, and therefore high recycling costs. Currently, recycling waste electrode materials containing high value metals, such as Li, Co, Ni and Mn, has been commercially successful. However, it faces an economical dilemma for recycling spent LiFePO4 cathode material which comprises cheap Fe and P elements except for high value lithium element, especially when the lithium price goes down. Here, this work demonstrates an electrochemical recycling strategy that directly combines lithium extraction from waste cathode materials with the regeneration of spent lithium iron phosphate cathode materials.

Different from conventional substitutional doping, a small amount of interstitial doping is more conducive to the entry of V5+ into the gap, which leads to lattice expansion.

In rate capability tests, an electrode coated with five ALD cycles of the Al2O3 thin film exhibited the best rate performance among the tested samples when the current rate was lower than 2 C. An electrode coated with 15 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 thin film delivered the highest average specific capacity-88.9 and 61.3 mAh/g at current rates of 5 C and 10 C, respectively-whereas a bare LiFePO4 electrode did not have any capacity at the 10 C rate. These results indicate that the Al(2)O(3 )coating can increase the cathode capacity at high current rates. In a cyclability test, the electrode coated with 15 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 thin film retained the largest capacity after 1000 cycles at a rate of 1 C. The specific capacity of the 15ALD sample at the 1000th cycle was approximately 68% of the capacity at the first cycle, whereas this ratio was reduced to 37% for the bare LiFePO4 electrode. These results indicate that the Al2O3 coating maintains the cathode capacity after many cycles. Thicker Al2O3 coatings result in a high degree of polarization and increased electrode resistance; therefore, the electrode coated with 25 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 thin film exhibited a poorer rate and cycle performance than the 15ALD and 20ALD electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and calculation of the Li(+ )diffusion coefficient revealed that the DLi of the bare LiFePO(4 )electrode was severely reduced after 1000 cycles relative to the electrode coated with 15 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 thin film. This led to a faster decay in the capacity of the bare LiFePO4 electrode after a long-duration test compared with the electrode coated with 15 ALD cycles of the Al2O3 thin film. We conclude that the rate capability and cyclability of the LiFePO4 electrode can be enhanced by depositing Al(2)O(3 )ALD thin films on its surface.

The experiment results indicated that the Fe3PO7 phase started to form through the reaction of Fe(OH)(3) and FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O during the sintering process. When the molar ratio of Fe and P (n(Fe):n(P)) was 1:1, pH=1.5.2.2, some Fe3+ ions will form Fe(OH)(3), and the yield coefficient increased with the pH and temperature. This is because the solubility product constant (K-sp) of Fe(OH)(3) was much less than the one of FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O, suggesting that the precipitate rate of Fe(OH)(3) was faster than FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O. Based on thermodynamic principles, aging may be an effective way to convert Fe(OH)(3) into FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O according to the phi-pH diagram of the Fe-P-Li-H2O system.

Herein, a NASICON-type NaFe2-xInx(PO4)(MoO4)2 (NFIPM) cathode is reported that shows a stable single-phase solid-solution reaction with significantly attenuated overpotential. Indium is strategically incorporated at the iron sites, expanding the lattice space to facilitate enhanced sodium-ion diffusion and also reducing the energy bandgap of NFIPM. Magnetic susceptibility (M-T) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) measurements reveal an increased spin state of iron following indium substitution. First principle calculations also confirm the lowering of the Na+ migration energy barrier post indium doping. The optimized NFIPM10 shows a specific capacity of 111.85 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C with remarkable cycling stability of up to 800 cycles at 2C.

Commercial carbonate-based electrolytes are incompatible with lithium metal anodes, while ether-based electrolytes, though more suitable, tend to degrade under high potentials. Here, a fluorine-free ether-based gel polymer electrolyte (FEGPE) has been developed via incorporating lithium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)azanide (LiTFSI) as lithium salt, 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) as solvents, and indium trifluoromethanesulphonate (In(OTF)3) as an initiator. DME is used to promote dissolution of the In(OTF)3 in DOL, along with enhanced ion transport of the FEGPE.

By optimizing the process parameters, significant improvements were achieved in key performance indicators, including the initial discharge capacity at 1C (132.85 mAh center dot g- 1), long cycling life at 10C (98.98 % capacity retention after 1000 cycles), and rate capability at 50C (99.65 mAh center dot g- 1). These improvements are attributed to the introduction of nitrogen-doped nanoframes, where the high-temperature decomposition of PVP leads to the formation of porous honeycomb-like structures, and nitrogen doping in the nanocarbon framework introduces defects and active sites, thereby promoting lithium-ion migration and facilitating electrolyte penetration. This simple, novel, and energy-efficient method demonstrates significant potential for the large-scale preparation of high-performance cathode materials.",High-performance cathode materials,Initial discharge capacity at 1C (132.85 mAh g-1) and rate capability at 50C (99.65 mAh g-1),10C,N/A,1000

However, the solid-solid interfaces may evolve over cycling, disrupting the ion and electron diffusion pathways and leading to rapid performance degradation. The development of solid-state lithium batteries has been hindered by the lack of fundamental understanding of the interfacial microstructure change over cycling and its relation to electrochemical properties. Herein, we prepared a quasi-solid-state lithium battery, 30%LiFePO4-55%Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)(3)-15%C| Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)(3)|Li, by spark plasma sintering, and employed it as a model system to reveal the microstructure evolution at the solid-solid interfaces with electrochemical performance of the batteries. The electrochemical assessment showed that the quasi-solid-state lithium battery exhibited a discharge specific capacity of about 150 mAh g(-1) in the first 80 cycles and then experienced severe capacity attenuation afterward, accompanied by a gradual internal resistance increase. Scanning electron microscopy observation showed that more cracks were formed inside the solid-state electrolyte and at the solid-solid interfaces as the battery cycled from 10 to 67 and 157 cycles. Detailed microstructure and phase analysis by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction discovered that the crack formation and performance decay were mainly caused by (1) the volume change of the LiFePO4 composite cathode during cycling, (2) the grain expansion of the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)(3) solid-state electrolyte at its interface with lithium anode, and (3) the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase layer, comprising Li2CO3, LiF, and LiTFSI, at the cathode-solid-state electrolyte interface. These microstructure changes built up over repeated battery cycling, ultimately causing the structure collapse and battery failure.

However, the safety of argyrodite-type Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl)-based ASSBs is still not assured because their thermal stability has been assessed under selected mild conditions. Herein, we introduce the poor thermal stability of LPSCl with Ni-rich layered oxide cathode materials as the trigger of thermal runaway. The charged composite cathode pellets containing Li1-xNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 and LPSCl are explosively burned at 150 degrees C even in Ar. Moreover, the mechanical abuse gives rise to violent burning at room temperature. This is due to vigorous exothermic chemical reactions between delithiated Li1-xNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 and LPSCl. However, LPSCl with LiFePO4 exhibits excellent thermal stability, such as no violent exothermic reactions even at 350 degrees C. This is because LPSCl is metastable with delithiated Li1-xFePO4. Moreover, LiFePO4 shows excellent electrochemical performance, such as a high reversible capacity of 141 mAh g-1 and stable capacity retention over 1000 cycles, despite the fact that LiFePO4 is known to be poorly electrochemically active for ASSBs.

Herein, we present an electrolyte design by significantly increasing the LiTFSI salt concentration within the dimethyl carbonate (DMC) solvent to solve the interfacial incompatibility. The increased salt concentration not only leads to the ion association mode's gradual evolution from a solvent-separated ion pair into a contact ion pair (CIP) but also enhances the oxidation stability. Although a CIP structure generally results in a relatively low ionic conductivity, the lack of free solvent molecules can enhance the compatibility between the designed electrolyte and electrodes.

The contents of all elements in recovered FePO4 product fully complied with the battery grade of national industry standard of China (HG/T 4701-2021). After battery-grade FePO4 precipitate separation, recovery solution (RS) with remaining Fe3+ was reutilized to remove 88.05 +/- 1.77% of P when mixed with BS wit RS/BS ratio of 2:1, thus achieving a Fe cycle utilization. Meanwhile, the recovery cost of 5.42 $/kg P and CO2 emissions of 80.83 kg/kg P were lower than those of current FePO4 industrial production (14.60 $/kg P and 110.60 kg/kg P). Finally, the LiFePO4/C cathode material based on recovered FePO4 from BS exhibited stable discharge specific capacity of 84.6-100.2 mAh/g during 100 charge-discharge cycles.

The limited wettability of commercial polyolefin separators in electrolytes restricts its utilization in extreme environmental conditions. In our work, we choose polypropylene (PP) as the precursor and can address the issue of poor wettability through suitable modification methods. Tannic acid (TA) and diethylenetriamine (DETA) were utilized to coat PP separator via hierarchical self-assembly approach, and the coating is further stabilized by taking advantage of the specific oxidizing properties of sodium periodate. This method scarcely increases the separator thickness or sacrifices the microporous structure of the original separator. The improved separator not only exhibits outstanding wetting capability and relatively high ion conductivity (1.24 mS cm-1), but also has the highest lithium-ion migration number of 0.74. This indicates that when the modified separator is applied to LIBs, its electrochemical performance is significantly enhanced. The enhancement in electrochemical performance of LIBs is attributed to the strong absorption and retention ability of the coating on the separator.

Lithium metal without intercalation and with excellent specific capacity is expected to support battery operation at low temperatures.

The Li metal anode is promising for the construction of next-generation high-energy-density batteries because of its ultrahigh theoretical capacity (3860 mAh(.)g(-1)) and low redox potential (-3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, the high activity of Li causes dendritic growth during cycling, which leads to cracking of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), increase in side reactions, and formation of dead Li. Several strategies have been proposed to address these issues, including use of electrolyte additives, high-concentration electrolytes, protection of the Li metal surface with various coatings, use of solid-state electrolytes, and design of a three-dimensional (3D) Li host for regulating the nucleation and deposition of Li metal. Among them, the design of a 3D Li host has proven to be a simple and effective strategy. However, the commonly used 3D Li hosts include nanostructured carbons, which are lithiophobic and, thus, provide limited interaction sites with Li+ ions, leading to the deposition of Li metal on the Li host surface. Therefore, it is necessary to design a 3D Li host with enhanced interaction with Li+ ions to achieve uniform deposition. Herein, we develop a soft-hard templating route to synthesize 3D macro-/mesoporous C-TiC (denoted as 3DMM C-TiC) nanocomposites, which has been used in Li metal batteries. The as-synthesized materials possess high surface areas (similar to 510 m(2.)g(-)1), ordered structures, large pore volumes, and excellent conductivity. The continuous plating and stripping of Li metal and the formation of the hierarchically porous structure with sufficient volume to allow uniform Li deposition result in the alleviation of the volume change. The high specific surface area significantly decreases the local current density and suppresses dendrite growth. Consequently, ultrasmall TiC nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in the 3D macro-/mesoporous framework, which improves conductivity, enhances their interaction with Li+ ions, and promotes the uniform deposition of Li metal. Therefore, the fabricated 3DMM C-TiC||Li battery displays stable cycling performance with improved Coulombic efficiency (98%) over 300 cycles.

A lower crystallization temperature not only results in a looser lattice for LiFePO4 material but also prevents crystal growth in higher temperatures and shortens the ion diffusion path. Experiments reveal that Mn doping can further broaden the lattice on this basis and thus ameliorate the Li+ diffusion property. The Density-Functional Theory (DFT) calculations not only support the above argument, but also predict that the LiFePO4 cathodes obtained from LiFePO4OH-to-LiFePO4 phase transition own lower Fe-Li antisite concentration (due to the high Fe-Li antisite formation energy of pre-lithiated precursor LiFePO4OH).

Adding functional small molecules and inorganic fillers are two of the simplest and most effective ways to improve the performance of SPEs. However, most of the time, both methods cannot be implemented concomitantly, and may even inhibit each other. Here, an original dual functional filler, consisting of hollow porous SiO2 nanospheres three-dimensionally wrapped by poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMPM), is blended with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and LiClO4 to obtain a composite solid electrolyte (CSE). Compared to the reference PEO SPE, the room-temperature ionic conductivity of the synthe-sized CSE is improved by 4 orders of magnitude reaching 1.3 x 10-4 S cm-1. Moreover, a lithium ion trans-ference number value as high as 0.81 is obtained. The CSE membrane is further assembled with a Li anode and a standard LiFePO4 cathode to obtain an all-solid-state battery showing high capacity (149.3 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C) and long-term stability (0.68 & PTSTHOUSND; loss of capacity per cycle, over 100 cycles).
