30,doc_30,"Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is recognized as a highly promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its two-dimensional layered structure and substantial theoretical specific capacity. The 1 T phase of MoS2, which significantly influences electrochemical performance, offers markedly higher conductivity. However, the metastable nature of 1 T-MoS2 complicates its direct synthesis under standard conditions, making it susceptible to transformation into the less conductive 2H phase through restacking, which in turn degrades its electrochemical properties. This study employed glucose molecules to facilitate the in situ growth of 1 T-rich MoS2 on N-doped graphene via a simple and efficient one-step hydrothermal method. The glucose molecules uniformly insert themselves into the MoS2 interlayers, effectively expanding the interlayer spacing while preserving structural stability and enhancing reaction kinetics. Additionally, the novel interface between carbon-inserted MoS2 and N-doped graphene (NG) creates an efficient transport channel for the rapid transfer of electrons and Li+ ions from graphene to the MoS2 plane.

In this study, a confined calcination method is introduced for the synthesis of molybdenum dioxide/molybdenum disulfide (MoO2/MoS2) nanoparticles within a porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (C/MoO2/MoS2). For such a goal, a novel stable poly(HIPE) constructed from polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polydivinylbenzene (PDVB), ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM), and ammonium persulfate (APS) was introduced as a reaction platform. In-situ calcination of AHM during pyrolysis led to the formation of ultrafine MoO2 nanoparticles in the nitrogen-doped carbon framework derived from PAN and PDVB carbonization. Gaseous sulfur from the thermal decomposition of well-distributed APS in the proposed poly(HIPE) formed a thin layer of MoS2 on the MoO2 nanoparticles to form a MoO2/MoS2 hybrid in the carbon foam. A key advantage of this synthesis method is the formation of ultrafine MoO2/MoS2 nanoparticles within the carbon matrix. This benefit arises from the confinement of the molybdenum precursor within the initial polymer, which subsequently transforms into a carbon support. In other words, as the polymer decomposes to establish the carbon framework, MoO2/MoS2 nanoparticles nucleate and grow within these restricted spaces.

The primary challenge encompasses not only the scarcity of anode materials exhibiting exceptional Na+ storage capacity but also the endeavor to achieve high areal capacity. To address this challenge, a comprehensive strategy is proposed that entails utilizing a highly conductive molybdenum dicarbide (Mo2C) current collector (denoted as CCM) as a supporting scaffold for the bottom-up growth of molybdenum disulfide nanosheets (MoS2, serving as the main active component) (denoted as CCM@MoS2). The CCM improves interfacial bonding with MoS2 nanosheets and offers additional capacity to accommodate the increased Na+ insertion activity. Both theoretical and kinetic analyses reveal that the enhanced Na+ storage properties primarily stem from favorable adsorption energy, reduced diffusion barrier, and intercalation pseudocapacitance due to the strong electronic interfacial interaction between active CCM and MoS2. Hence, the as-prepared optimized CCM@MoS2 electrode exhibits a superior areal capacity of 6.36 mAh cm-2 at 0.4 mA cm-2, excellent rate capability of 1.02mAh cm-2 at 24 mA cm-2 and long cycle life up to 500 cycles at 4 mA cm-2.

However, the interlayer distance of similar to 0.48 nm between MoS2 and C (lower than 0.62 nm of pristine MoS2), the unconspicuous enhancement of intrinsic conductivity of MoS2, and the inevitable decrease in capacity due to the introduced low-capacity C undoubtedly hamper ion transport and storage, thus resulting in limited enhancement of capacity and fast-charging performances of UIS. Herein, we propose a magnetic-atom strategy for UIS via a one-step high-pressure vapor-phase synthesis method, during which the interlayer electrostatic repulsion is in-situ constructed by magnetic-atom Fe and/or Co doping to adjust the interlayer distance from 0.48 to 0.64 nm. In addition, the doped magnetic atom can regulate the electronic structure of UIS to obtain the bandgap of 0 eV to enhance electron transfer. Importantly, the doped magnetic atom can be reduced to superparamagnetic metallic nanoparticles during conversion reactions, which can store abundant spin-polarized electrons to induce strong surface-capacitance effects, thus boosting ion transport and storage. Consequently, the magnetic-atom strategy endows the UIS with ultrahigh reversible capacities of 1572.1/738.5/542.3 mAh/g at 0.1C, 971.2/383.5/209.8 mAh/g at 5C after 3000 cycles, and 761.5/340.8/204.5 mAh/g at 20C as Li/Na/K-ion-battery anodes, respectively.

Of the vacancies, bridge sites, and top sites of lithium adsorbing vanadium (V), the top site has the lowest adsorption energy, indicating that lithium will preferentially adsorb the top site of vanadium (V). Through first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of the top position of adsorbed vanadium (V), it is found that at a temperature of 300 K, the total energy of the system and the magnitude of the total temperature fluctuation can reach a steady state, indicating that lithium can exist at the top position of stably adsorbed vanadium (V). Moreover, the interlayer spacing of the double-layer VS2 reaches 3.67 A, which is larger than the interlayer spacing of graphene. From the top position to the vacancy, its diffusion barrier is only 0.20 eV. Its interlayer spacing is larger than the double-layer graphene's, and its diffusion barrier is lower than graphene's, indicating that lithium has very good diffusivity on the VS2 surface, and lithium can migrate quickly on the VS2 surface, which is conducive to the rapid charge-discharge process of LIB. In addition to excellent electrical conductivity, VS2 has good mechanical properties. The calculated Young's modulus is 96.82 N/m, and the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio do not decrease after adsorbing lithium, indicating that the rigidity of VS2 will not be reduced in the diffusion and migration process of lithium. On the other hand, it has excellent deformation resistance. In order to be more accurate and closer to the actual situation, a double-layer VS2 model is constructed, with a maximum number of lithium atoms adsorbed between layers being 18. The calculated theoretical capacity of VS2 (466 mAh/g) is higher than the theoretical capacity of graphene (372 mAh/g). Our results indicate that VS2 has excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical stiffness, making it a promising cathode material for lithium-ion batteries.",Cathode,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The structure of the amorphous Mo3S13 chalcogel is derived through operando Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray pair distribution function (PDF), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis, along with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. A key feature of the three-dimensional (3D) network is the connection of Mo3S13 units through S-S bonds. Li/Mo3S13 half-cells deliver initial capacity of 1013 mAh g(-1) during the first discharge. After the activation cycles, the capacity stabilizes and maintains 312 mAh g(-1) at a C/3 rate after 140 cycles, demonstrating sustained performance over subsequent cycling.

According to the defect formation energy, the formation of S-vacancy in monolayer VS2 is an endothermic reaction while the O-doping formation is an exothermic reaction. The difference in electronic structure arrangement near the defects results in varied adsorption energies of Li ions at the same site from that of pristine VS2. Two defects can significantly reduce the diffusion energy barrier of Li ions on the VS2 monolayer surface, 0.016 (for S-vacancy) and 0.117 eV (for O-doping), compared with pristine VS2 without defects (0.233 eV). In addition, these two defects are beneficial to the intercalation and de-intercalation of Li on the surface of VS2, so they can provide excellent rate performance for LIBs. All the Pristine, O-doped, and S-vacancy VS2 monolayers can stably adsorb the upper and lower Li layers, with theoretical capacities of 1397, 1419, and 1442 mAh/g, respectively.

In this regard, we introduce in this work a facile, low-cost and scalable method for the synthesis of nanocomposites of amorphous molybdenum sulfide (a-MoSx) and hierarchical porous carbon and have systematically inves-tigated their performance for sodium ion storage. In the synthesis, ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and thioacetamide are used as molybdenum and sulfur sources, respectively, with abundant corn starch as the carbon source and KOH as an activation agent.

It has also been shown that the annealing of MoSx@HPC results in the formation of crystalline MoS2 nanosheets anchored in the hierarchical porous carbon matrix (MoS2@HPC). The as-prepared nanocomposite MoSx@HPC1 at an optimum carbon content of 32 wt% delivers a high specific sodium storage capacity of 599 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and a high-rate performance with a retained capacity of 289 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1.

246,doc_246,"Vanadium diselenide (VSe2), with large interlayer spacing, is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, due to the existence of a conversion reaction, VSe2 will encounter a huge volume change during charging/discharging, resulting in electrode pulverization. On the other hand, VSe2 nanosheets are prone to disordered stacking during the deintercalation of sodium ions, affecting the next intercalation. Therefore, VSe2 embedded into a three-dimensional N-doped carbon framework (VSe2@3D-CN), was constructed to solve the above problems. Firstly, the three-dimensional carbon framework, with void spaces, can maintain the structural integrity of the electrode during charging/discharging, improving cycle performance. Secondly, the structure that VSe2 nanosheets are embedded in a three-dimensional carbon framework can avoid disordered stacking for VSe2, which can maintain an open insertion channel of sodium ions. Thirdly, nitrogen doping can increase the active sites, enhancing the absorption of sodium ions in the carbon layer and thus obtaining superior rate performance. Based on the synergistic effect of the above modification strategies, outstanding electrochemical performance was obtained. After charging and discharging 150 times at a current density of 200 mA/g, the specific capacity of VSe2@3D-CN is up to 465 mAh/g. Besides, the sodium storage model of VSe2@3D-CN has been built via ex situ XPS and ex situ HRTEM tests, which provides an important reference for improving cycle performance.",Sodium,465 mAh/g,200 mA/g,N/A,150
247,doc_247,"Layered materials are among the most promising anode candidates for sodium-ion batteries, but suffer from limited interplanar spacing and poor electrical conductivity, resulting in unsatisfactory electrochemical perfor- mance. Herein, a novel layered composite of Zn2SiO4 and carbon (Zn2SiO4/C) is designed by a simple one-pot hydrothermal intercalation strategy. The Zn2SiO4/C shows unique superlattice-like lamellar configuring that the Zn2SiO4 layers and graphene-like carbon layers are alternately stacked, forming a sandwich-type structure. Such alternating layered contexture endows Zn2SiO4/C with improved conductivity and stability. In addition, the interplanar spacing of the Zn2SiO4/C achieves 1.44 nm, larger than most state-of-the-art layered materials, allowing the fast ion transfer from bulk electrolyte to the inner surface. As such, the Zn2SiO4/C delivers a high reversible Na storage capacity of 374 mAh g-1, and it presents no visible capacity decline during the cycling test. More importantly, even under a very high current density of 20 A g-1, the capacity remains 180 mAh g-1, suggesting an ultrafast energy output within 33 s (approximate to 109 C).

Nevertheless, they are generally vulnerable to low conductivity and sluggish ion diffusion as well as severe volume variation. Here, a strategy of filling metal atoms into anion vacancies is proposed and applied to the example of WS2. More specifically, sulfur vacancies are produced and partially filled by Co atoms simultaneously in WS2 (denoted as Co@WS2-S-V), creating a highly reactive micro-structure composed of Co-W-S, which can not only effectively provide more active sites, but also boost the charge transfer and reaction kinetics. Consequently, the as-prepared Co@WS2-S-V exhibits superior K+ storage performance, which includes an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 382.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 A g(-1). Besides, Co@WS2-S-V still maintain a capacity of 112.6 mAh g(-1) after 1100 cycles at 2 A g(-1) while the capacity fades to similar to 0 mAh g(-1) after only 800 cycles for WS2.

Herein, a facile one-pot hydrothermal method is developed to achieve sulfur substituting and carbon compositing simultaneously and employed to boost the sodium ion storage properties of MoSe2. The effects of sulfur substituting and carbon compositing on the redox kinetics and sodium-ion storage performance are investigated. In short, sulfur substitution mainly enhances the electronic/ionic conductivity and specific capacity of the MoSe2 by tailoring the electron structures and creating anionic vacancies. Carbon compositing mainly improves the cycling stability due to the alleviative aggregation of active materials and the prohibited active materials dissolution.

252,doc_252,"WS2 is a promising anode for potassium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and unique layered structure. However, the intercalation-dominated K+ storage, large K+ diffusion barrier energy, and poor intrinsic electrical conductivity limit its practical application. Based on these problems, a synergetic effect of N, O codoping and atomic-interface engineering is performed for WS2, in which interoverlapped superstructure of unilamellar N, O co-doped WS2 and C (NO-WS2-C) is designed to maximize the atomic-interface contact area between WS2 and carbon. The unique NO-WS2-C enables the occurrence of the conversion reaction between WS2 and K+, which produces vast ultrasmall W nanoparticles (similar to 2 nm), resulting in the construction of a space charge zone on the W surface to enhance K+ storage. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations indicate that the unique NO-WS2-C possesses a low bandgap (0 eV) and K+ diffusion energy barrier (0.2 eV) to boost K+ transport. Consequently, an ultrafast K-ion storage capability (107.8 mAh/g at 20C), and an ultralong cycling life over 5000 cycles at 5C with an extremely low capacity loss per cycle of 0.007 % are obtained, which are the best among previously reported WS2-based anodes..",WS2,N/A,"20C, 5C",0 eV,5000 cycles
