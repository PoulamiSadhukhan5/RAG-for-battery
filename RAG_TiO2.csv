As a bridge between the lithium metal anode and the lithium plating, the C/TiO2 layer acts as an ion redistributor to form a higher lithium-ion concentration region near the electrode interface, thus weakening the dendrite growth caused by concentration polarization. The synergistic effect of SiO2 and C/TiO2 scaffold has achieved dendrite-free metal lithium deposit. Therefore, with the Janus film modified lithium metal electrode, the symmetrical cell can achieve 1500 h cycle at a current density of 3 mA cm-2, accompanied by a low overpotential of 80 mV.

The combination of nanoengineering and carbon capping processes has been proven to address these issues. However, most carbon capping techniques cannot ensure uniform capping and fail to form a continuous conductive phase between active materials. This work proposes a green (solvent-free) and facile method for constructing SiOx/C-TiO2 (SCT@CN) nanocomposites by creating a three-dimensional carbon conductive network from gelatin-derived carbon and doping with titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs).

Interlayer expansion of intercalation hosts is one of the effective techniques for facilitating Na-ion diffusion. For most ionic layered compounds, interlayer expansion relies on intercalation of guest ions. It is important to investigate the role of these ions for material development of SIBs. In this study, alkali-metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, and Cs+) with different sizes were intercalated into lepidocrocite-type layered titanate by a simple ion-exchange technique to achieve interlayer modulation and those were then evaluated as anode materials for SIBs. By controlling the intercalated alkaline ion species, basal spacings of layered titanates (LTs) in the range of 0.68 to 0.85 nm were obtained. Interestingly, the largest interlayer spacing induced by the large size of Cs did not yield the best performance, while the Na intercalated layered titanate (Na-ILT) demonstrated a superior performance with a specific capacity of 153 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1). We found that the phenomena can be explained by the high alkaline metal ion concentration and the efficient utilization of the active sites in Na-ILT.

262,doc_262,"The performances of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) depend heavily on sulfur hosts with the desired properties including excellent electronic conductivity, high sulfur loading, strong polysulfide capture, and active catalytic centers. Here, we demonstrate 2D partially oxidized Ti3C2Tx MXene (PoMXene) can be cross-linked by Sb, N coimplanted carbon (Sb-NC) through Ti-O-Sb bond to synthetize Sb-NC/PoMXene. It is shown that the nanostructuring Sb-NC/PoMXene provides fast ion/electron transport channel and robust 3D architecture to alleviate volume variations. Significantly, the interweaved polar interfaces benefit rich binding sites from Sb nanoparticles, N atoms, TiO2 and Ti3C2Tx towards polysulfides, and the Sb-NC could catalytically accelerate redox kinetics, thus efficiently suppressing polysulfide shuttle. As a result, the Sb-NC/PoMXene/S hybrids represent high capacity (1148.4 mAh g-1 at 0.1C) and long cyclability (570.6 mAh g-1 after 700 cycles at 2C). When the sulfur loading is increased to 4 mg cm-2, the thick cathode still maintains a high areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm-2 with a decay of only 0.10% per cycle over 100 cycles at 0.2C. The studies pave a novel pathway to design nanostructured electrodes and promote catalytic performances in LSBs.",N/A,"1148.4 mAh g-1, 570.6 mAh g-1","0.1C, 2C, 0.2C",N/A,"700, 100"
263,doc_263,"Graphene quantum dots (GQDs), a newly emerging zero-dimensional material, have achieved widespread interest in energy storage applications. However, the complicated preparation processes of GQDs involving harsh reagents/conditions, cumbersome purification procedures, or costly precursors hinder their practical use. Herein, we reveal a low-cost and eco-friendly solvothermal method to obtain an FeS@GQDs composite, with coal tar pitch (CTP) as.natural GQDs.. When evaluated as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), this composite delivers an outstanding reversible capacity of 718.7 mAh g(-1) over 200 cycles at 100 mA g(-1); as comparison, the reversible capacity of pure FeS is only 16.3 mAh g(-1) in the same situation. Furthermore, the FeS@GQDs composite shows much better rate performance and higher initial Coulombic efficiency than pure FeS. These prominent electrochemical properties of the FeS@GQDs composite profit from the successful coupling between FeS and GQDs by forming C-S-C, which provides a large specific surface area and well-developed porosity, leading to improved electrical conductivity and enhanced structure stability. In terms of energy storage, this approach is a potential way to prepare GQDs-based composites on a large scale without the expensive precursors, harsh reagents, as well as complex preparation conditions.",FeS@GQDs,718.7 mAh g(-1),100 mA g(-1),N/A,200

Intentionally constructing functional heterostructures based on a variety of two-dimensional (2D) substances proves to be an extremely efficient method for capitalizing on the shared benefits of these materials. By elaborately designing the structure, a greatly escalated steadiness can be achieved throughout electrochemical cycles, along with boosted electron transfer kinetics. In this study, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was utilized to alter the surface composition of multilayer Ti3C2Tx MXene, contributing to contriving various layered heterostructure materials through a precise adjustment of the reaction temperature. The optimal composite materials at a reaction temperature of 500 degrees C (defined as MX500), incorporating MXene as the conductive substrate, exhibited outstanding stability and high coulombic efficiency during electrochemical cycling. Meanwhile, the reactive sites are increased by using TiS2 and TiO2 at the heterogeneous interfaces, which sustains a specific capacity of 449 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1) and further demonstrates their exceptional electrochemical characteristics. Additionally, the noted pseudocapacitive properties, like MXene materials, further highlight the diverse capabilities of intuitive material design.

265,doc_265,"MoO2 is an exciting candidate for next-generation energy storage. It can be used for fast-charging applications in nanoscale form, but its kinetic performance is often limited by insulating MoO3 surface oxide layers. Here, we developed methods to produce polymer-templated porous MoO2 powders where electrical conductivity was well-maintained throughout the structure, even in the presence of some surface oxidation. Porosity, pore size, and crystallite size were controlled by varying the amount and size of the colloidal templates and through calcination temperature. The electrochemical performance was correlated with nanoscale structure: samples with high porosity, medium pore sizes, and good crystallinity display optimal rate capabilities, with over 100 mAh g(-1) delivered in 3 min and 93% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. Kinetic studies were performed on samples with the largest and smallest crystallite sizes to understand the charge storage mechanism. In the sample with the smallest crystallite size, 85% of the total stored charge was capacitive, compared to 60% for the largest crystallite size. Sloping voltage profiles in materials with smaller domain sizes further suggest suppression of intercalation-induced phase transitions. This work thus provides insights into the mechanisms of charge storage in nanoscale MoO2 and design parameters for the production of fast charging materials. (C) 2022 The Author(s).
